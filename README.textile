h1. sed_patterns

h2. Pre Alpha Work In Progress

Not really ready for anything other than some more development work right now.

h2. Description.

This plugin allows you to import or packages of elements (pages/forms/styles/plugins/sections/prefs/strings/js/images) that form a "pattern":http://developer.fellowshipone.com/patterns/.

Importing all elements of a pattern is not always possible as there may be name clashes between the elements being imported and existing elements.

Packages are uploaded via the admin interface and installed in much the same way as smd_admin_themes installs themes for the admin interface. 

h2. Dependencies

This plugin relies upon the gzinflate() php function which is not available on every installation. If it is not available, the plugin will disable itself with an explanatory message.

h2. To Do.

* Nearly everything!
* Grab more of the import mechanism from sed_cleaner.
* Grab scripting mechanism from sed_cleaner for instructions file.
* Develop a way of performing substitutions into the elements being inserted into the site (for example, the capture of an email address for injection into an email contact form or some other preference.)
* Package definition & creation mechanism (either via export from a site or by a different construction tool.)
* Addition of post-auto-install 'next steps' page.

h2. Packaging your own patterns.

For now, I'm using a specific packager to build one pattern.

I setup a the directory structure shown below for an example pattern called 'contact form'.

bc.. patterns/
    |
    `---- contact form			# This is the root of your pattern.
                |---- info
                |       |---- directions.script
                |       `---- help.textile
                `---- elements
                        |---- zem_contact_reborn.plugin
                        |---- zem_contact_lang.plugin
                        |---- rvm_counter.plugin
                        |---- contact_thanks.misc.form
                        |---- contact_email.misc.form
                        |---- contact_counter.misc.form
                        `---- contact_form.page
